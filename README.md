# Rominator Updated
A PCB update to the popular [ROMinator by BMOW](https://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator/) with the following tweaks:
 - Aligned the CPU header in-line with the placement of the wires on the CPU
 - Removed 512k / Plus pin headers in favor of solder-pad jumpers
 - Improved ROM socket placement in order to avoid physical interference with 128k Chassis
 - Improved "HI" and "LO" ROM markings
 - Improved header labelling on the bottom of the PCB
 - Rounded corners so less chance of cuts (both people and wires!)
 - Made the board symmetrical for aesthetics
 - Open Hardware ([oshwlab](https://oshwlab.com/stephenarsenault/bmow-rominator-revision))
